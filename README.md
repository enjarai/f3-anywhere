# F3 Everywhere

This mod lets you use all vanilla F3+<insert key here> shortcuts in any game menu, not just in the world.
This is most primarily useful for resource pack creators, 
who can now use F3+T to reload resources without having to close a menu.

Because of how tiny this mod is, it shouldâ„¢ work on any Minecraft version, future and present, that is newer than 1.12.
